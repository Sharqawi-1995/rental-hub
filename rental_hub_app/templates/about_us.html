            <h2>Welcome to For Rent</h2>
            <p>
                For Rent is a web platform that connects property owners (Hosts) with people looking for apartments and houses (Guests). 
                Hosts can list their properties for rent, and Guests can browse, view details, and contact the Host.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our mission is to simplify the rental process and make it easier for property owners to find reliable tenants 
                while helping renters find their perfect home.
            </p>
            <p>
                At For Rent, we understand that finding the right property or the right tenant can be a challenging process. 
                That's why we've created a user-friendly platform that streamlines the entire rental experience. Whether you're 
                a property owner looking to rent out your space or someone searching for their next home, our platform provides 
                all the tools you need to make the process smooth and efficient.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our platform offers a secure and reliable environment for both Hosts and Guests. Hosts can easily manage their 
                property listings, while Guests can search through available properties with ease. We believe in transparency, 
                security, and providing the best possible experience for all our users.
